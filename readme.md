# WebGL Starter Kit

WebGL is freakin` awesome. And three.js makes it even easier to be awesome.

But still, there is quite a lot to do to get something running. At the very least you need:

- a scene
- a renderer
- a camera
- some lights
- an input loop
- an animation loop


Beyond that, you might want to:

- resize from the DOM
- convert mouse/touch events
- raycast mouse clicks
- draw HUD elements over screen

That's a lot of things to take care of before a single polygon is drawn.

So to help you get started, we've wrapped up all these functions in a helpful `WebGLWidget` class, where you can override some sensible defaults, only when you need to.

Get started straight away!
